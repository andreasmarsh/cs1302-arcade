1. **DONE:** Thoroughly explained and wrote down our thought process and our logic for the group 2 game, Mancala. We have shared blueprints and possible UI files for Mancala and the Menu Screen amongst a shared google doc.

2. **TODO:** By our next reflection, our goal is to have a functioning Menu Screen, have the physical scene graph of Mancala, and the beginning of our logic for the group 1 game.

3. **PROB:** Deciding on where to begin our logic for the group 1 game has been a struggle. Although hesitant to begin, we are looking forward to shedding more light on the group 1 game.

    1. **DONE:** Created a function menu screen, and decided on a group 1 game. Set up the mancala scene.

    2. **TODO:** By our next reflection our goal is to have the logic of tetris planned out as well as a fully function mancala.

    3. **PROB:** We have still been avoiding the logic for tetris/group 1 in general, however with this break I believe we will be able to sort this out. Also difficulties with configuring how to iterate through the mancala board.

    1. **DONE:** Created mancala visual board with displayed images and setup tetris scene and images to be displayed

    2. **TODO:** By our final submission, functionality should be added to both games

    3. **PROB:** We ran into problems with setting up tetris functionality as well as issues in mancala with the gridpane however we are near solutions and progress should exponentially increase as we progress
